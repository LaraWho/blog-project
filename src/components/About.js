        My name is Geoff; I am a PhD student at the University of Manchester
        enrolled in the centre for doctoral training (CDT) in regenerative
        medicine. My project involves building 3D models of the neurovascular
        unit to help understand the mechanisms which cause dementia. To do this
        I use stem cells, 3D biomaterials, and 3D-bioprinting.

        Alongside my research I also like to write science articles which
        communicate the latest research in neuroscience and biofabrication
        (NEUROFABRICATION) to scientists and science enthusiasts. The website
        you are on now is my portfolio of these articles and also to all things
        Geoff (Just Geoff).
